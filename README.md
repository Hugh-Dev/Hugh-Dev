<p align="justify">I am a professional who adapts in an agile way to change in this dynamic industry, I give priority to innovation as a response to uncertainty. As a Python Developer I have been able to participate for more than 7 years in projects and talks of great importance for the community such as Pycon Argentina, The development of TDA open digital television in Latin America together with countries such as Brazil and Argentina. In this long apprenticeship I have discovered a passion for computer security, open source and above all being able to share my knowledge. :jigsaw:: </p>
